== Module 1: Introduction to Developer Hub
:navtitle: Introduction to Developer Hub

== Objectives

Developer Hub gives you a centralized portal to:

* Create new services through templates
* Manage deployments with ArgoCD and Helm
* Author and publish documentation with TechDocs
* View all services and infrastructure in one place using the Backstage catalog
* Enable developers to deploy safely, with guardrails and governance

== Guided Exercise

Navigate around Developer Hub:

. *Home:* Shortcuts to useful links
. *Catalog:* Browse and manage all your apps, services, APIs, and components
. *Create…:* Golden path software templates, where users can quickly scaffold new projects using company-approved standards

  * Launch the Kafka Streaming Instance from the software templates. This will deploy an ArgoCD application and code updates in GitLab, which in turn provisions a Kafka instance that will be used in Module 3.

== Easter Eggs!

* Find the two easter eggs in Developer Hub.

== Takeaways

* Discover and reuse services, templates, documentation, and tools
* Standardize software delivery processes
* Integrate CI/CD pipelines, observability, security, and more
* Reduce cognitive load by giving devs a “home base”
